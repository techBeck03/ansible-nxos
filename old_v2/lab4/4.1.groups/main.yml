  # Note that no variable files are explicitly imported. Ansible will import the variables automatically, when defined
  # in the standard directory structure.
  # If the same variable is defined in both host_vars and group_vars, host_vars will have higher precedence and hence
  # will be used in the tasks.

  tasks:
  - name: configure hostname        # The variable is imported from the host_vars directory
